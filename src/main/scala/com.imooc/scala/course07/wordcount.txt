I have accomplished my first academic year in University of Southern California as a Master student in Viterbi school of Engineering. I’m currently doing my internship in Shanghai, China at Ping An Technology. During the last two semesters, I’ve taken and passed four courses as a full-time student. I enjoyed these four courses and my first year in U.S.A a lot, and those wonderful learning experiences make me look forward to going back to USC to fulfill the last courses and achieve my master’s degree there.
